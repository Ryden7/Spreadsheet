# Spreadsheet

Created by Rizwan Mohammed for CS 3500, January 28th 2016

The Spreadsheet project is a spreadsheet application that functions very similarly to Microsoft Excel.

Users can enter text, numbers, or do arthimetic calculations called Formulas by typing in the contents box and hitting enter. 
Only '+', '-', '*', or '/' operators are available. Users are also allowed to store variables and give them values. 
The user can then use the '=' operator in order to do calculations. For example, '=A1+B1' would add the variables A1 and B1, 
this arthimetic on variables is called a formula. This spreadsheet also has features that allow you to create new spreadsheets, 
open saved spreadsheets or to save the current spreadsheet. Please note, when saving a spreadsheet, the .ss will be appended.
